# Immersivecraft-MK

ImmersiveCraft is perfect for people who want to play minecraft in a more realistic way, and who don't want to have a overly tedious gameplay.

150 new or updated mods for 1.12.2

Rework of the modpack played by MarcusKron in his youtube series

This modpack is based on immersive engineering and its addons, like immersive petroleum or immersive tech, immersive hempcraft.

ImmersiveCraft also provides a realistic experience, thanks to dynamic lights, immersivecraft mod, rustic, better with mods and so on...

It  offers a great experience using shader mods

optifine and shader mods aren't included in the basic curse version

Beware that Optifine may have some incompatibilty issues with Forge

You can download optifine here: https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252foptifine.net%252fdownloads

There are some utility mods too which make the whole gameplay a bit easier
