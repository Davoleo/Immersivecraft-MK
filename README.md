This modpack is based on immersive engineering and its addons, like immersive petroleum or immersive tech, immersive hempcraft.


ImmersiveCraft also provides a realistic experience, thanks to dynamic lights, immersivecraft mod, rustic, better with mods and so on...

 
It  offers a great experience using shader mods

Although you can install optifine, if you do beware that I won't be able to offer any support for issues about it.
